# Data Info

The data was extracted from FiveThirtyEight and Guardian. 

This data set contains information on 50 states with 34 variables and 467 observations.
It covers the year 2015. In this analysis, I am only examining 5 variables in order to establish if there is a correlation or not.

My research interests center around victims of police brutality and analyzing whether or not it is related to certain variables.

The variables I chose to examine are:
- State
- Cause of death
- Victim Armed or not 
- Race/ethnicity

Number of death per state and by race
```{r graph 1, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/bintou/Downloads/Data Analysis/Rplot05.jpeg")
```
---
Cause of death and victim armed or not
```{r graph 2, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/bintou/Downloads/Data Analysis/Rplot07.jpeg")
```
